## Project Title
Supplier Risk Analysis and Prediction using Python

---

## Problem Statement
In today’s competitive business environment, organizations depend heavily on suppliers for timely delivery, consistent quality, and cost efficiency. Poor supplier performance can lead to production delays, quality issues, and increased operational risks. However, identifying high-risk suppliers in advance is difficult due to large volumes of performance-related data.

This project aims to analyze supplier performance data and develop a Python-based analytical approach to identify and predict supplier risk levels. The study focuses on using data analysis techniques and basic predictive modeling to support better procurement and supply chain decision-making.

## Objectives of the Study
The main objectives of this project are:

1. To understand and analyze supplier performance data using Python.
2. To clean and preprocess supplier-related data for effective analysis.
3. To perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key factors affecting supplier risk.
4. To develop a predictive model to classify suppliers into different risk categories.
5. To evaluate the performance of the predictive model using appropriate metrics.
6. To provide managerial insights and recommendations to reduce supplier-related risks.
